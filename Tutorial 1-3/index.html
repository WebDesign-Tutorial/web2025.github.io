            <h2>CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the 2024 Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW). In the past,
                the workshops have been held in Guilin (2006), Hanoi (2008), Daegu (2010), Kuching (2012), Gold Coast
                (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020, online) Shanghai (2022, hybrid), and
                Jakarta (2023, hybrid), PKAW 2024 will be collocated with <b> the 21<sup>st</sup> Pacific Rim International Conference 
                on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2024)</b> and held in Kyoto, Japan in November 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of
                knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI). PKAW 2024 will
                continue the above focus and welcome the contributions to the multi-disciplinary approach of human and big
                data-driven knowledge acquisition and AI techniques and applications. Wide range of topics related to
                knowledge acquisition and representation are greatly welcome.

            <h3>Paper Submission</h3>
            <p>
                PKAW will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review in, or has already been published in, or has already been accepted for publication in, a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. If part of the work has been previously published, authors are strongly encouraged to cite and compare/contrast the new contributions with the parts that were already published before. The paper must substantially extend the previously published work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Proceedings of PKAW 2024 will be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.</b> PKAW 2024 will adopt <b>single-blind</b> rule for the reviewing process, i.e., the authors do not know the names of the reviewers, but the reviewers can infer the names of the authors from the submission. All papers for the review should be submitted electronically using the conference management tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNAI template. The paper should not exceed 12 pages long (excluding references). For accepted papers, the latex source files and a camera-ready version are required to be submitted using the Springer LNAI template.
